              <p>Luckily there are many others who created their own pixel-board. Out of the many attempts one that stood out the most is the one done by a <a href="https://youtu.be/0yT_qYHqlOU">Japanese youtuber</a>.</p>
              <img width=300px height=auto src="https://qiita-user-contents.imgix.net/http%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2F0yT_qYHqlOU%2F0.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.0.0&auto=format&gif-q=60&q=75&w=1400&fit=max&s=7f36acb5f22bee0bd3702b4c2df8a56d" >
<p>As the video documents the entire process of making his own board (and it comes with a full write up on the process), I decided I can reference his work in order to create mine.</p>
<p>Hence here are some specifications I came up with:</p>
<p><u>Structure</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Stand used to display the pixel-board to be made using the CNC cutter</li>
<li>Head gear to be 3D-printed and resin casted.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Electronics</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Using the ATTINY85, an NeoPixel strip will be arranged into a large screen which will be able to display pixel art. The display will be controlled via a Bluetooth module and the entire circuit will be powered by a battery pack and voltage regulator.</li>
<li>The NeoPixel LED strip can display 6 different pixel arts using 153 LED Lights.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Materials</u></p>

              <h3 ><u>Design</u></h3>

<p>The entire process of designing the pixel-board from scratch took an estimate about a week. The only reference I have is exisitng projects and lots of images from the show and game, the rest is trial and error. It is difficult to document how I created it step by step so spoiler alert here is the final design!</p>
<img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/7EWKEZX.png" >
<p>I will go through how each part is designed and what considerations I took.</p>
<p>There are 2 parts in this project: the Pixel-board and the wooden display stand.</p>
<img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/qzFDfUJ.png" >

<h4 ><u>Pixel-Board</u></h4>
<p>The Pixel-board is split into 2 parts, the screen and the head gear.</p>
<img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/5eYJb7C.png" >

<p><u>Neopixel Screen</u></p>
<p>This is the most important part of the project as it basically contains all the electronics. It basically is a screen made out of Neopixel LED lights.</p>
<p>The screen needs to be able to display certain pixel art images, so using google sheets I mapped out the LED&#39;s and made some images I wanted to be displayed and in total I will require 153 LED lights.</p>
<img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/xi0PBz7.png" >
<p> I will also need the screen to be able to store the electronic components.</p>
</p><img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/F5BKmHI.jpg" >
<p>As of now the main Idea is to have the neopixel strip stuck onto a panel which will be placed inside a frame, then a board would be layered ontop of the strips for the controller and bluetooth module.</p>
</p><img width=700px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/gOziBNU.jpg" >
<p>I started with a face template I found online and traced the neopixel panel. As I want the LED lights to be visible throught the panel I tried to make it as thin as possible: the main panel is extruded to 3mm, then at the back I cut out the shape I that want to lay the neopixels on slightly thinner.
</p><img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/cP3cETp.png" ><img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/9abaOZs.png" >
<p>Then I reused the template to trace out the frame. Its designed such that the neopixel panel would just fit at the front of the screenwithout falling out.</p>
<p>I originally planned this part to be 3D printed, so as a precaution I split the frame into 2 parts in the event the whole frame takes too long to print. (Ideally if possible the entire frame should be printed out as a whole)</p>
</p><img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/pYNvbS4.png" >
<p>The back of the frame I decided to use the laser cutter to cut out.</p><img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/h9uwRQV.png" >

<p><u>Head Gear</u></p>
<p>This is the most time consuming yet not very important part of the project. As it is intended to be worn over your head, It was hard to get the proportions right.</p>
<p>The way it is designed is such that the parts comprise of multiple pieces for easy 3D printing, as well as easy painting incase the filament colour needed is not available.</p>
<p>Exploded view of the Right side of the head gear:</p><img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/92x5EKD.png" >
<p>When fabricating the parts, most of the parts will have to be 3D printed, except the flower shaped dome which is done from the <a href="mould.html" target=" ">Molding and casting project</a>.</p>
<img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/5ASGjFK.png" >
<p>This piece will have to be fabricated twice for both sides, and they will be connected with a cat ear head band which is also planned to be printed out.</p>
<img width=500px height=auto src="https://i.imgur.com/zjCg07i.png" >
<h4 ><u>Wooden Display Stand</u></h4>
<p>When not in use it would be nice to have something for it to be displayed on, so I created a human head profile. Below is a document showing how I made the stand.</p>
