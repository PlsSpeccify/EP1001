          <h3 ><u> Project Idea</u></h3>
<p>For my project, I decided to create a "cosplay prop" replica from the character &quot;Rina Tennoji&quot; from the TV Anime series &quot;Love Live Nijigasaki&quot;.<br>
My only explanation is why not?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cwSEbyF.jpg" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
<p>In the show, Rina uses a electronic display board that displays pixel arts of emotions and faces, which is the item that I&#39;m planning to replicate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >Design Brief</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Title:</strong> <u>Neopixel mood-screen</u> (a.k.a Auto Emotion Convert Rina-chan Board)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Functions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A screen made out of NeoPixel LED&#39;s that can display emotions using pixel art.</li>
<li>To be controlled via Bluetooth</li>
<li>Can be used as a cosplay prop</li>

</ul>
<h3 ><u>Research</u></h3>
<p>There are many people who attempted to recreate the Rina board, however one that stood out the most is by a <a href='https://youtu.be/0yT_qYHqlOU'>Japanese user</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQBJ3lXU8AIGv4f?format=jpg&name=small" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
<p>In his design, the display is controlled by push buttons, and all parts are 3D-printed, what&#39;s good is he documents his entire process from designing to fabrication and programming, hence I will be referencing his methods in order to create mine, with some added features.</p>
<p>You can read his documentations <a href='https://qiita.com/hamahamabe/items/9216df345bb908eb5199'>here</a>, note it is all in Japanese.</p>
<p>Here are my project specifications:</p>

<h3 ><u>Design</u></h3>
<p>The entire project consists of 2 parts: the Pixel screen (where the electronics are) and the Head gear (aesthetics), in which are all designed in FUSION 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Design sketches</u></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/F5BKmHI.jpg" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>
<p>I Designed the frame and light panel as separate parts, where the panel will just rest at the bottom of the frame.</p>
<p>The Neopixel will be placed in series through the board. As there is a distance between each LED, I will have to bend the trip to squeeze them in.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/34ZLv6E.jpg" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>
<p>On google sheets I created a neopixel map. The numbers shows the LED number. In total 136 LEDs are used. This would make it easier to program patterns using array.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QetkhIg.png" style="zoom:80%;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fit the other electronics in, I decided to place a panel above the Neopixel strips, where the controller and other components will be placed on top.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gOziBNU.jpg" style="zoom:40%;" /></p>
<p>As for the design of the other parts, I have tons of image reference from the show and game.</p>
<p> It is difficult to explain in detail the process of designing the parts so I will go through what I had to consider during designing. Note all the measurements and proportions I used are just estimations and referencing back and forth with the design in the show, including rough measurements of my actual head. </p>
<p> Firstly here is the final design, there is a time paradox here but I will go through the different parts. The colours will not be loyal to the original as this is made as a prototype.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/rS6BzhF.png" style="zoom:50%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5eYJb7C.png" style="zoom:60%;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>NeoPixel screen</u>
The Pixel screen is the first part I designed as it is the most important part in the project. It will house all the electronics. The screen can be split into 3 parts:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/fWibUeC.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I started of with designing the light panel as I had a template to use. I simply created a sketch, uploaded a canvas and traced over it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cP3cETp.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
<p>The light panel will be where the Neopixel will be taped onto. It must be thin enough such that light can pass through it, so I extruded it to 1mm thick with the edges at 2mm for a more secure frame.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MfcZt86.png" style="zoom:60%;" /></p>
<p>The thickness of the frame heavily depends on how the electronics are placed inside it, hence It will be printed last once all the electronics are mounted onto the light panel. </p>
<p>In the design I split the frame into 2 different parts, but it can be printed as a whole.</p>
<p>The back is simply to cover up the electronics. Holes will be cut through to allow access to the switch and for the Bluetooth module to be exposed.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h9uwRQV.png" style="zoom:40%;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[write how it will be mounted on]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Head gear</u></p>
<p>The head gear is the second part I designed, and the most time consuming one.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EWghSGm.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
<p>The head gear is mostly 3D printed. It consists of the Left and Right sides and the Head band. Again the measurements are just throwing in random numbers in consideration of my head size until the proportions look close to the original. I focused on one side, then for the other I simply mirrored the design over.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uGY25Ps.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
<p>The way it was designed was such that it consist of multiple parts. This would allow the printing time to be split into multiple parts, and also the ease of painting the individual parts in the events the filament used is not the correct colour.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/92x5EKD.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >__<u>Fabrication</u></h3>
<p>Most of the headgear parts are simply 3D printed.  It is just a matter of patience and hoping the prints turn out fine....</p>
<p><u><strong>3D Printing</strong></u>
I printed the first few parts and I realised the parts do not fit perfectly</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GSMTkSZ.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p>I ended up having to sand the parts down until it fits, which is a very tedious job.
Not wanting to reprint the head compartment and not wanting to spend more time sanding it down, I ended up cutting the loop to fit the piece in and you can see a huge gap from a nice fit.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/wGnV04Z.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p>To solve this I ended up going back to the FUSION 360 design and adding clearance to all parts that are going to fit together by reducing the parts by 0.6mm.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BxMxANd.png" style="zoom:46%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xCDjVBL.png" style="zoom:40%;" /></p>
<p> The following prints came out to fit; not a perfect fit but its better than sanding it to fit.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/x3RNUJt.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p>At that time there was no black filament available, so I spray painted the parts black. I secured the headset onto the sides with screws.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4lI04lJ.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/uTq13UE.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p><u><strong>Mold and Casting</strong></u></p>
<p>I used the CNC cutter to create a mold and then casted the flower part out of resin. You can see the whole process <a href='https://plsspeccify.github.io/EP1001/docs/moulds.html'>here</a>.</p>
<p>I had to make 2 casts for both sides of the piece.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8karVTU.jpg" style="zoom:29%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vqazPlU.jpg" style="zoom:11.5%;" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5eRVWTE.jpg" style="zoom:11.5%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sQhyKNZ.jpg" style="zoom:10%;" /></p>
<p>The resin cast adds weight to the back of the headset, allowing it to balance when the light display is added. It fits nicely into the 3D printed dome.</p>
<p>The headset is complete!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9usM8Jv.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p>For the screen I had trouble printing the 1mm thick screen as big panels can easily be warped,usually you can solve this by forcing the layer onto the build plate with glue but printing it at a slower speed gave a pretty good result.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9q31U7o.jpg" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>
<p>For the case I simply printed it blue.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BVaFf7X.jpg" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>
<p>I used the laser cutter to cut out the back cover.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IdKkNcG.jpg" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 >__<u>Electronics and programming</u></h3>
<p>For the controller I decided to use the  ATTINY1614. It has  16 KB In-system self-programmable Flash memory and 2 KB SRAM, which would be sufficient to control all 138 LEDs. (Note 1 Neopixel LED would require 3 bytes of RAM). You can view the pinouts here. </p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/master/megaavr/extras/ATtiny_x14.gif" style="zoom:40%;" /></p>
<p>You can read more about it via the <a href='http://academy.cba.mit.edu/classes/embedded_programming/t1614/ATtiny1614-DataSheet-DS40001995B.pdf'>Datasheet</a> or <a href='https://github.com/SpenceKonde/megaTinyCore/blob/master/megaavr/extras/ATtiny_x14.md'>SpenceKonde</a>.</p>
<p>Then I went ahead and designed the board.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/75wXMdS.png" style="zoom:60%;" /></p>
<p>In the circuit I included a built in button and LED and I pulled out pins 11,12,13.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/eWeHH6D.png" style="zoom:60%;" /></p>
<p>Following that, I generated the gcode with Mods, cut the board out with the Stepcraft CNC cutter and soldered the parts together.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PNVryjg.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PLsXiRU.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p>To program the Tiny 1614 I will need a UPDI.
For the Arduino to recognise the board, I had to install megaTinyCore by Spence Konde under board manager.</p>
<p>Next are the I/O devices.</p>
<p>The electronics comprises of an Input and Output device: Bluetooth module and the Neopixel strip. My idea of the program is having an app connected to the controller via Bluetooth. The app will contain multiple buttons where each button will display a pixel art pattern on the Neopixel.</p>
<p>I first tested the board on an Arduino UNO, then I will transfer it to the ATTINY1614 board.</p>
<p><u><strong>Output - Light Panel (Neopixels)</strong></u>
The light panel is the tedious way of creating a neopixel matrix. The printed panel came out really transparent, so I drew out how the neopixels will be arranged and placed the panel over it for reference.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/g7Rfmsu.jpg" style="zoom:11%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/tiQefEu.jpg" style="zoom:11%;" /></p>
<p> Preparing the Neopixel strips I first cut them to the desired length. Unfortunately the neopixels I bought were abit too big than the intended design (the original called for WS2812B-2020 which are small enough you can probably fit more pixels in than required). Before pasting them on I first trim the sides smaller and bend the corners with a stick to prevent sharp folds or you may destroy the connection. I also drew arrows to indicate the connections.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M3hst3Q.jpg" style="zoom:24%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yuXngSa.jpg" style="zoom:10%;" /></p>
<p>I then used double sided tape to stick the neopixels on. For every strip placed I tested it to ensure the connections are ok.</p>

  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/1Ewa5JC.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  The your browser DIED cus the video is too stronk for you browser!
</video>
<p>Half way into pasting the neopixels I realise if the panel is thin enough to be seen through, the neopixels can be seen taped on from the front. To solve this I ended up sticking a sheet of paper to hide them.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CURYwXV.jpg" style="zoom:11%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LzoWDa4.jpg" style="zoom:11%;" /></p>
<p>It ended up a very tight fit, managing to place all the neopixels in. After pasting all the pixels I soldered the connecting wires, labelling red for 5V, green for DATA and white for GND.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zjuRPUp.jpg" style="zoom:11%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sxwtLjS.jpg" style="zoom:11%;" /></p>
<p>The Panel nicely fits into the frame. 
From the initial design I intended to cut a panel is separate the Neopixels from the other electronics, but that may make it more bulky so I simply insulted the LEDs by covering it with tape.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GykBhpA.jpg" style="zoom:30%;" /></p>
<p>The WS2812B Neopixel strip consists of 3 pinouts: VCC, GND and DATA.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/030/892/medium800/leds_Wiring-Diagram.png?1456961114" style="zoom:50%;" /></p>
<p>The Neopixel only requires 5V, which means I can simply connect it straight to the controller. The DATA is connected to the output pins, which will control the LED turning on/off and its colour.</p>
<p><strong>How patterns are displayed</strong>
Back to the LED map I made, each LED is numbered from 0-137. In total 136 LEDs are used.</p>
<p>First is to declare the Pinouts:</p>
<pre><code class='language-c++' lang='c++'>#include &lt;Adafruit_NeoPixel.h&gt;
#define PIN   6 // pin connected to the NeoPixels
#define NUMPIXELS      136 // no. of led
Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels = Adafruit_NeoPixel(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);
</code></pre>
<p>So DATA will be connected to pin 6 of the Arduino.</p>
<p>For each pattern only certain LEDs will be turned on. This can be combined to form an array:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hyTp7f6.png" style="zoom:60%;" /></p>
<p>So to Display the pattern &quot;Smile&quot;, we can declare an array like this:</p>
<pre><code class='language-c++' lang='c++'>const PROGMEM uint8_t smile[] = { // smile pattern
4,5,16,13,22,27,38,31,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,68,70,75,77,88,89,96,97,105,104,101,100,112,113,125,124,121,120,128,129,136,137
}; //LEDs to turn on
int patternsmile = sizeof(smile); //No. of LEDs
</code></pre>
<p> <em>smile[]</em> consists an array of which LEDs to turn on, and <em>patternsmile</em> consists of the number of LEDs used to display the pattern.</p>
<p>Next is to setup the Neopixels. This code is to be placed in void setup:</p>
<pre><code class='language-c++' lang='c++'> pixels.begin(); // This initializes the NeoPixel library.
  for(int i=0;i&lt;NUMPIXELS;i++){pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0,0,0));} //set to off
   pixels.show();
</code></pre>
<p>Setting the colours to (0,0,0) makes the LED turn off. The colours are set by (RED,GREEN,BLUE). so (255,0,0) would turn the LED red, while making all the Values 255 will make the LED white. (255,20,147) will make LEDs pink. If you want a specific colour you can just google &quot; (your colour) html RGB code&quot;.
Now to put the array to use and make the LEDs display:</p>
<pre><code class='language-c++' lang='c++'>for(int i=0;i&lt;NUMPIXELS;i++){pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0,0,0));} //set to off
    
for(int point = 0; point &lt; patternsmile; point++) { // read out the pattern
led = pgm_read_byte_near(&amp;smile[point]);
pixels.setPixelColor(led, pixels.Color(255,20,147));} // increment next point in pattern
pixels.show(); //display pattern
</code></pre>
<p>We first turn off all LEDs by setting the colours to (0,0,0). Then the for loop will go through the <em>smile</em> array and set the LED assigned numbers to On. Then it will display the pixels.</p>
<p>To control the display I assigned a variable to each display and use if statements.</p>
<pre><code class='language-c++' lang='c++'>if (count ==0){
	for(int i=0;i&lt;NUMPIXELS;i++){pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0,0,0));} //set to off
  }
  else if (count == 1){ //smile
	//display neopixel smile
  }
  
  else if (count == 2){ //evil
    //display neopixel evil
     pixels.show();
  }

    else if (count == 3){ //cry1
    //display neopixel cry1
  }
  else{
    count = 0 ; // count reset to 0
  }
</code></pre>
<p>If a button is used to increase the number is pressed, if the button is pressed 2 times, it will display the &quot;evil&quot; pattern, above 3 and counts will reset to 0.</p>
<p>When trying to upload the program, the compiled failed. For the Neopixels to run, Clock must be set to 16MHz Internal. After that it uploads properly.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vnieNaL.png" style="zoom:70%;" /></p>
<p>Plugging it to the Arduino to test the pixels, they aren&#39;t line up perfectly but at least the program and connections work!</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/evcHiqB.jpg" style="zoom:11%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FpiIDVF.jpg" style="zoom:11%;" /></p>
<p><u> Blink animation</u>
Usually when making light animations, you would display the first frame, use delay() then display the next frame, unfortunately that would break the if statemen. For this I used millis(), which returns the number of milliseconds passed since the Arduino board began running the current program.</p>
<pre><code class='language-c++' lang='c++'>unsigned long ms;        //time from millis()
unsigned long msLast;    //last time the LED changed state
boolean blinkState = 0;        //current LED state
#define LED_ON 5000
#define LED_OFF 200         // interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

void loop(){
  ms = millis();
      if (ms - msLast &gt; (blinkState ? LED_ON : LED_OFF)) {
           int led = 0;
        if (blinkState == LOW) {
       int led = 0;
            
    for(int i=0;i&lt;NUMPIXELS;i++){pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0,0,0));} //set to off
    for(int point = 0; point &lt; patternnormal; point++) { // read out the pattern
   led = pgm_read_byte_near(&amp;normal[point]);
    pixels.setPixelColor(led, pixels.Color(255,20,147));}
    // increment next point in pattern
      blinkState = HIGH;
    } else {
            
      for(int i=0;i&lt;NUMPIXELS;i++){pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0,0,0));} //set to off
    for(int point = 0; point &lt; patternblink; point++) { // read out the pattern
   led = pgm_read_byte_near(&amp;blink[point]);
    pixels.setPixelColor(led, pixels.Color(255,20,147));}
      blinkState = LOW;
    }
    pixels.show();
        msLast = ms;
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>This creates the blinking animation.

<p><u>Input: Bluetooth Module</u></p>
<p>I used the HM-BT05 Module as it can be recognised by an Iphone. The module requires 4 pins: VCC, GND, TX and RX.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.electroschematics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2-Hardware-LED-Test.jpg?fit=730%2C400" style="zoom:%;" /></p>
<p>The RX pin requires 3.3V, so a voltage divider is used to bring the voltage down.</p>
<p><u>Bluetooth control with Iphone</u></p>
<p>There are multiple apps that can let you communicate with Arduino Bluetooth modules. Two apps I would reccomend:</p>
<p> <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elegoo-ble-tool/id1441940983'>ELEGOO BLE TOOL</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Its interface is made for Arduino bluetooth robot cars, but one of the useful features is setting control buttons. With a push of a button you can send can characters or messages to the module in Text or Hexadecimal. You can name the buttons as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OW31lfY.png" style="zoom:17%;" /><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mur2lHg.png" style="zoom:17%;" /></p>
</li>

</ul>
<p> <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bitblue/id1403675953'>BitBlue</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Has multiple interfaces, most useful is Terminal mode if you want to send messages to the module.<BR>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8HLzRJo.png" style="zoom:17%;" /></li>

</ul>
<p><u>Bluetooth Program</u></p>
<p>Here is a simple program to control an LED light, taken from <a href='https://makersportal.com/blog/2019/10/14/bluetooth-module-with-arduino'>Makers portal</a>.</p>
<pre><code class='language-c++' lang='c++'>#include &lt;SoftwareSerial.h&gt;
#define LED 4
SoftwareSerial BT05(3, 4); // TX,RX
char appData;  
String inData = &quot;&quot;;
void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println(&quot;BT05 serial started at 9600&quot;);
  BT05.begin(9600); // set HM10 serial at 9600 baud rate
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); // onboard LED
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // switch OFF LED

}

void loop()
{

   BT05.listen();  // listen the HM10 port
  while (BT05.available() &gt; 0) {   // if HM10 sends something then read
    appData = BT05.read();
    inData = String(appData);  // save the data in string format
    Serial.write(appData);
  }

  if ( inData == &quot;F&quot;) {
    Serial.println(&quot;LED OFF&quot;);
    digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // switch OFF LED
    delay(500);

<p>Here RX is connected to pin 4 through a voltage divider and TX to pin 3. LED is connected to pin 13.</p>
<p>The LED control works by reading the input. Sending &quot;F&quot; will turn the LED off while sending &quot;N&quot; Will cause the LED to blink. You can also view the Arduino serial com.</p>
<p>Using the ELEGOO app, I programmed the Off button to send &quot;F&quot; and the Blink button to send &quot;N&quot;.</p>

<p>Next is making the wires I followed the circuit diagram as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iZzZHIL.png" style="zoom:100%;" /></p>
<p>I soldered the wires and resistors together and used shrink tubes to cover the bare wires.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/sMwR7DW.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p>For the power source I used a 3.7V Lipo battery. As the circuit requires 5 volts I used the DC-DC boost converter to step up to 5V.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/F25WgiC.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p>Then I wired everything else and secured the cover with screws.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kMOQ2lN.jpg" style="zoom:100%;" /></p>
<p>With that the Neopixel board is done!  ＼(＾▽＾)／</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 ><u>Assembly</u></h3>
<p>The headgear and Neopixel screen are secured with screws.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/f3USBVH.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p>Having a large hole to mount the frame to the headset was a design error, so I glued a washer in the hole and screwed it in place, then I used a hollow dome to cover the screw.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6JQA1q7.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p>One feature is the ability to wear it. After measuring I noted there is a 4cm gap from my nose to the front of the board. A very quick (and scuffed) method is sticking a pair of goggles to wood, where it will be stuck at the back of the screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/7UjnEGS.jpg" style="zoom:15%;" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8Oy3ufB.jpg" style="zoom:20%;" /></p>
<p>It was simply secured on with double-sided tape. This method of making it wearable is not very effective, given the wood blocks add on weight and your nose alone will not be able to support its weight. This makes you unable to see or breathe when wearing it, other than that it just looks bulky. So its a temporary fix and can be removed. </p>

<p>In all, the final design is close to its original reference, although some changes can be made and there are multiple more things that must be solved in order to perfect it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neopixel used can be smaller (preferably WS2812-2020), this can allow more unique images to be displayed.</li>
<li>Light panel design should be made of square grids instead of flat to give off the pixelated effect.</li>
<li>Finding a way to allow users to see the front when wearing the frame. One idea is to make the light panel translucent so the wearer will be able to see whats infront, or mount something like a VR headset at the back and put a camera infront (something like a drone VR headset).</li>
<li>A method of making it wearable (that&#39;s not attaching a block at the back). Several methods like redesigning the headset with ergonomics of a human head in mind. Placing a ose support at the back of the screen works also, but it may get crushed by the weight of the screen, so the weight of the screen must be reduced.</li>

</ul>

<p>Yes you can wear it... but at what cost?</p>
