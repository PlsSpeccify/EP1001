            <p>When operating machines, it is advice that you thoroughly familiarise yourself with it and to strictly follow the safety rules and regulations. When in doubt do not hesitate to ask lecturers or Technical Support Officers.</p>
            <p><small></p>
            <blockquote>

                <ul>
                <li><p>A clean, neat, orderly machine and work area is the first step in safety. Keep all guards and covers
                in place and all machine cabinet doors closed.</p>
                </li>
                <li><p>Do not operate machines or equipment until you have been properly instructed and authorized to
do so by your Instructor/TSO.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not start the machine or spindle until the work-piece and work-holding devices are securely
fastened.</p>
</li>
<li><p>During any activity that requires the handling of work-holding devices, tools, measuring devices, or
work-piece parts in the cutting zone, the machine’s motors must be in the stationary mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Know the position of the Emergency Stop push-button of the machine. Activate it during
emergency situation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not lean on any moving parts when the machine is in operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you must remove hot tooling or sharp tools, switch off the machine and put on the hand gloves.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Never clear chips when the spindle is rotating. Never remove chips with your bare hands. Use a
brush or tool designed for that purpose.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When operating machine, it requires your undivided attention. No “horseplay” or “monkey about”
is allowed in your work area. If you need to attend to another matter, stop the machine until you
can give it the full attention required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be alert for loose, worn, or broken parts and abnormal sounds and noises. When you suspect a
problem, do not operate the machine. Report the problem at once to the Instructor or Technical
Supporting Officer (TSO) for corrective action.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not use machine, if safety guard is not properly installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not leave any materials lying on the floor. Unwanted materials should be put into the scrap
bins.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When operating the machine tools, ensure that other workshop users are not exposed to danger.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always use a brush to sweep off all waste materials from the workbench.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not forget to clean up your workplace and machine tools after each use.</p>

            <h4 id="-u-machine-hazards-u-"><u>Machine hazards</u></h4>
<p>Machinery hazards can be categorised into 2 types: Mechanical and non-mechanical.</p>
<p>Some examples of mechanical:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Entanglement hazard</strong><br>
Loose clothings or hair gets caught in moving parts of a machine</li>
<li><strong>Cuttng hazard</strong><br>
Machines with moving cutting elements</li>
<li><strong>Crushing hazard</strong><br>
A part of a body gets caught between two moving parts or a moving part and stationary object of amachine</li>
<li><strong>Friction &amp; Abrasion hazard</strong><br>
Friction burns when encountering rough surfaces moving at high speeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of non-mechanical:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fall from Heights Hazards</strong><br>
Heavy objects falling from a height</li>
<li><strong>Noise Hazards</strong><br>
Machine generates noise that can cause harm when exposed over time</li>
<li><strong>Electrical Hazards</strong><br>
Machines using high voltages</li>
<li><strong>Heat-related Hazards</strong><br>
Machines using heating elements</li>
<li><strong>Chemical Hazards</strong><br>
Machines using harmful chemicals</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="-u-placards-risk-levels-u-"><u>Placards risk levels</u></h4>
<p>Machines are ranked on their degree of safety. These can be often found on their placards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Risk</strong><br>
User must be trained in the use of the machine, no supervision required.</li>
<li><strong>Medium Risk</strong><br>
User must be trained in the use of the machine, moderate severity of potential hazard.</li>
<li><strong>High Risk</strong><br>
User must be trained in the use of the machine, supervision required. High sverity of the hazard.</li>
</ul>

<li>SP Emergency hotline : 6772-1234. </li>
</ul>
<p>When making an emergency call, it is essential to give precise information as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name of caller</li>
<li>Location (block and room number)</li>
<li>Nature of emergency e.g. fire, explosion, violent or abusive behaviour, etc</li>
</ul>
<p><U>First Aid &amp; AED </U><BR>
For minor first aid assistance, please contact your school’s general office.</p>
<ul>
